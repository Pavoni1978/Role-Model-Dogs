[View the Live Project here](https://pavoni1978.github.io/Role-Model-Dogs/)

This is a website promoting dog training, located in Edgemead, a fictional address. The purpose of this website is to provide information about what we can provide and how we can make a dog more pleasant to own. The website also includes the option to enquiry about one of the classes and times that classes are offered.

## Features:
### UI/UX:
#### **Colour Scheme:**
- The main colours used are in a grey and white scale. The text is pulled forward from the background, assisting legibility. These colours also compliment the illustration and photographic resources on the website highlighted with a 4px black border. The black text on grey background makes for easy reading in all platforms.
In the event of creating print media, the previous use of grey and white scale in the “branding” of the Role Model Dogs will be far more cost effective in printing and designing expenses. 

#### **Typography:**
- The Helvetica font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. The website header also uses Helvetica font with sans-serif as backup. This creates a nice consistancy throughout the site for easy reading on all devices.

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.
- [W3C Markup Validator - Results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&showoutline=yes&showimagereport=yes&doc=https%3A%2F%2Flizac9.github.io%2Fproject1-glasgow-necropolis%2Fform.html)
- [W3C CSS Validator - Results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Flizac9.github.io%2Fproject1-glasgow-necropolis%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

The website was also tested through Lighthouse on Chrome for its Accessibility Score.

#### **Debugging:**
The responsiveness of the website was challenging in general. The class day and times page was particularly difficult to position on page. The social media icons would appear invisible in the bottom footer on all pages. This was resolved by xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.   Devs tools and the application "Am I responsive?" helped to visualize and resolve issues associated with using different screen sizes to display media. The website was launched in different browsers such as Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge. Throughout the entire development, the website was tested in each phase.

## Deployment
The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps:
1. In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
2. From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch.
3. Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
4. The live link can be found [HERE - Role Model Dogs](https://pavoni1978.github.io/Role-Model-Dogs/)

#### **Commits:**
Some of the commits messages are not as precise as I would have wanted them to be. Did not find it easy to learn the GitHub, GitPod databasis. Looking forward to migrating to Code Anywhere for my portfolio two project.
